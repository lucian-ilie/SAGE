SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
=============================================================================
SAGE is a program to assemble genomes using reads from genome sequencing
machines.  It is recommended that the reads be corrected with RACER before
assembling the genome with SAGE.  SAGE is designed to run on a 64-bit Linux 
environment with gcc installed. For running SAGE on viral or bacterial genomes
it is recommended to have 10GB of memory available.  Larger genomes will 
require more memory.

INSTALLATION
=============================================================================

Extract the tar file with the following command:

	tar -xf sage.tar

Change directories to the sage folder and type:

	make

RUNNING SAGE
=============================================================================
The reads should be corrected first using RACER which can be downloaded here:

	http://www.csd.uwo.ca/~ilie/RACER

Run RACER using the command:

	RACER <inputReads> <correctedReads> <genomeLength>

"RACER" is replaced by the appropriate version used.
<inputReads> is the input file containing the reads in FASTA or FASTQ format.
<correctedReads> is the file name that will contain the corrected reads.
<genomeLength> is the approximate length of the DNA molecule in base pairs.
	- if only parts of a genome were sequenced, then only the total length of 
	  those parts should be used (instead of the length of the total genome).
	- a precise value is not necessary, an approximation will work well.

SAGE can then be run with the corrected reads using the command:

	SAGE <inputFile(s)> <outputDir> <minOverlapLength>


<inputFile(s)> are the FASTA or FASTQ files that contain the corrected reads.
<outputDir> is the name of the output directory.
<minOverlapLength> is the minimum length two reads must overlap to have an edge in 
	      the overlap graph. Note that <minOverlap> must be smaller than 
	      the read length in the inputFile.

INPUT DATASET
=============================================================================
SAGE accepts FASTA and FASTQ input files. All the reads in the input files 
should have the same length. Mate pairs should be placed one after another in 
the FASTA file.  The mate pairs should be forward-reverse oriented.


OUTPUT FILES
=============================================================================
SAGE outputs the single-end contigs in a file named SingleEnd.fasta and the 
paired-end results are in a file named 
{firstInputFileName}_SAGE_assembly_{overlapLength}.fasta
There is also a text file with information about the assembly in a file named 
{firstInputFileName}_SAGE_output_{overlapLength}.fasta
